# ringcode

## Description

A circular, color-based barcode format, written as a school project.

The aim is to be easily recognizable and not necessarily store a lot of data.

The practical limit is around 10 rings (56 bytes).

## Site

The tag generator uses vanilla JavaScript, and the reader uses OpenCV.

The reader supports uploading images as well as reading pictures taken from the browser (i.e. via the webcam).
